Project: Browser stats pull

The objective:
We want to automate a process that fetches and stores web browser usage data over the past few years for countries with a lower middle income.

Resources:
- The following URI gives a json response containing countries that appear in this list of lower middle income countries:
  http://api.worldbank.org/countries/?incomeLevel=LMC&format=json
- The following URI downloads a csv file which contains browser usage stats for the major browsers:
  http://gs.statcounter.com/chart.php?statType_hidden=browser&region_hidden=AL&granularity=yearly&statType=Browser&fromYear=2008&toYear=2012&csv=1
  Only one country is returned per response.
  The URI contains the query parameter 'region_hidden' which accepts a 2 digit ISO code. This dictates the country returned.
- Coding language is of your preference 
- It's preferred the database be MySQL, but you can use others if you have to.
